 16/10/19 [V5.9 R0.9] /MK Bug Fix - Removed TDeleteEventRec from EventsAfterDelete as the event had already been deleted at this stage so no need to delete again.
                                  - This caused the next event in the animals EventTable to be deleted - Roger Barclay.
                                  - Added UpdateInvalidPregDiagEventType to EventsBeforeDelete after the event is deleted.

                                                         where these costs have not copied into the Purchase table - Una Carter.

 17/01/20 [V5.9 R1.8] /MK Change - CheckFiles - Shane suggested that I set all ModifiedOn dates to todays date which will push all groups to the server regardless if they are synced.
                                                The reason for this is that the sync was crashing on machines where the ModifiedOn is null as the server requires a value.

 28/04/20 [V5.9 R4.0] /MK Change - GetEventLookupData - Changed the queries to the new qMainGridMilkDiskTrans & qMainGridMilkDisk so that animals that were sold
                                                        or animals that don't have milk history in the current lactation but do have in the previous lactation
                                                        will then show milk history on the main grid.

                          Change - CheckFiles - A few drugs added in the last while so I have made it available to KHerd users without the App.

 02/11/20 [V5.9 R6.8] /MK Change - RemoveReportFromStore - Added a new function that deletes the Weighing Report from the Reports table because of the new Weighing Report types.

 02/11/20 [V5.9 R7.0] /MK Change - SetReportAsFavourite - If the report is a key report then delete it and add it back in again so it appears on bottom of favourite list.

 03/11/20 [V5.9 R6.8] /MK Change - OpenAllTables - Moved the Weighings table to the end of procedure so it doesn't upset the program opening.
                                                 - Moved Ownerfile to the top of the procedure as its a required table.

 04/11/20 [V5.9 R7.2] /MK Change - CheckFiles - No need to store the key reports in the Reports table as we're building these from a string array.

 05/11/20 [V5.9 R7.2] /MK Change - CheckFiles - Delete the old Weighing Report favourite from the Reports table as we have a 3 seperate favourites.

 23/11/20 [V5.9 R7.5] /MK Additional Feature - CheckFiles - Update all service events that have sexed semen selected to have the new Sexed Semen service type.

 26/11/20 [V5.9 R7.6] /MK Bug Fix - GetUserHerdId - I moved the OwnerFile.Open in OpenAllTables up to the top as it is a primary table to open.
                                                    The reason I did this was, if the OwnerFile can't be opened (because of corruption) the user
                                                    wasn't told if the table before OwnerFile was also corrupted. Shane had a look at the change
                                                    I made and found that the setting of OwnerFile.Active to AlreadyOpen was causing other forms
                                                    that locate on the OwnerFile were getting the error "OwnerFile : Cannot perform this operation on a closed database".
