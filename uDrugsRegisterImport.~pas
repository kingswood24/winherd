                                                 from the medicine table. If the drug is on the online database then default unit depending on drug type on the server.
                                               - Allow the user to edit the quantity purchased before the drug purchase is saved.

                                                                     and animal treatment withdrawal date is after sale date.

   14/12/17 [V5.7 R6.3] /MK Bug Fix - actRunExecute - If a drug is in the VetLink file more than once and it wasn't in the database prior to VetLink import,
                                                      it then gets added by the DrugFinder code below so when we loop through to the next purchase of the medicine
                                                      we need to search for the DrugID in the Medicine table. Bug was that the drug was being added for every purchase - Tom Crosse.

                                    - If user deselects all treatments bar one and saves the treatment, all treatments that were unticked were still saved.
                                    - If user deselects all treatments bar one, saves the treatment, reopens the vetlink file after treatments are saved,
                                      all treatments that were not saved are still unticked.

                                   - Created new form private procedure GetRecordCountByFilterString that gets the count of animals in a filtered table from SQL based on filter.
                                   - If the drug is not valid then new procedure, MarkDetailRecordAsNotImported, sets it as imported/ignored via SQL.
                                   - OnFormDestory add checks for Out of Memory and Out of Resource errors as there is sometimes an Access Violation error closing VetLink.
                            Bug Fix - actRunExecute - Looping through found drugs - If the drug exists in the FDetailTable then use it don't go searching again for the VPA number.

   03/01/19 [V5.8 R5.9] /MK Change - StoreAnimalsInAnimalDetailTable - Added progress bar to indicate animals being matched - Kieran Savage/GL request.
                                                                     - Added BeginFullUpdate/EndFullUpdate so grid isn't scrolling when looping through records - SP request.

   25/02/19 [V5.8 R7.1] /MK Bug Fix - EditVPANo1Click - If Unit selected before clicking button in VPA field then assign selected unit to rest of records for this drug.
                                                      - Disable controls of grid while closing and opening to stop "List index out of bounds" error - Noel Keane.

                                                           that were not saved should then appear - Una Carter.
                                   - ImportFile - Don't set HeaderDetailRecorded here as this will not allow for file to be read in again, with new name, if purchases fail - Una Carter.

   25/06/19 [V5.8 R9.4] /MK Bug Fix - actRunExcecute - Use global GetNewDrugCode that is used by WinData.MedicineNewRecord.

   06/11/20 [V5.9 R7.2] /MK Change - EditVPANo1Click, ManualEnterVPANo1Click - SP suggested that I don't set the FocusedRecordIndex but instead use a locate on the Id.
